# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_2202001_Amijeet_Ghosh
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various regression models. The project explores data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the classic Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers, including their age, sex, passenger class, and whether or not they survived.

# Project Steps
1. Data Loading: Load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and analyze the distribution of features.
3. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values (e.g., using imputation) and encode categorical features (e.g., using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding).
4. Feature Selection: Select the relevant features and the target variable ('Survived') for the model.
5. Model Training: Train different regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, on the prepared data.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error).
7. Visualize Results: Visualize the performance of different models to compare their effectiveness.
# Models Used
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
# Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
# Usage
* Clone the repository.
* Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the code.
* Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
# Results
The project will output the performance metrics for each trained model, allowing you to compare their effectiveness in predicting Titanic survival. A visualization of the model performance will also be generated.

# Future Improvements
* Explore other feature engineering techniques.
* Implement more advanced regression models.
* Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
* Analyze the feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.
